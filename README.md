# GSM + GPS Tracker Project
This project is a small, Arduino-based GSM + GPS tracking device designed to run from a Li-ion battery and send location data through a SIM800L module.
The goal is to build a compact, portable emergency tracker that can send location information when activated.

# It uses three main modules:
Arduino Nano (main controller)

SIM800L (GSM communication)

NEO-6M GPS (location tracking)
